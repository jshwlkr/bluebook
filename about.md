The Bluebook is a collection of my work-related notes. Nothing contained within this website represents the policies and values of my employers, past or present. This is a personal space that contains work-in-progress thoughts that do not offer any measure of perfection. Anything you find here is not authoritative and is not a representation of my best work. It is, however, a representation of my interests and current knowledge. To that end, I have a right to be incorrect or incomplete in my work here and I have a right to change or remove content as I continue to learn. Be aware URLs, content, and site structure are not permanent.

These notes are collected via Obsidian. This site is constructed via Maxence-L's Jekyll-based digital garden template [notenote.link](https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link). It is hosted and built via Github and Netlify.
