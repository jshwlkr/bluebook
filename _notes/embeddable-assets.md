## What
We very briefly and somewhat silently explored this idea in past iterations of the news site by generating an embed to display an infographic that was too complicated to either accessibly create as an image or construct directly in the editor. It met with some mild success (I believe there was some interest in porting it's design elements into the magazine). However, the idea is to produce interesting/compelling/creative elements that can live independently of our platforms and therefore be used outside our platforms by anyone who can copy and paste an embed. We could create an embed, display it in a news story or some kind of landing page, and lab sites or other similarly resource-constrained units could do the same. This likely means they would need to be somewhat self-contained, but it could also mean they could be animated or interactive. Formats might include maps, infographics, and visualizations. We could find both accessibility and brand wins in this arena. It could also potentially make the mobile experience a better one.

## How
Nothing here has been through any kind of extensive testing, so their long-term viability is in question. Embeds require hosting. In our case we could use Github or, somewhat less conveniently, our AFS space.

- [AI2HTML](http://ai2html.org/)
This was what we used the first time. You create via Adobe Illustrator and use AI2HTML to translate what you've produced to into something that can be embedded. Created by the NYT.

- [Daily Graphics](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics-next)
This option requires coding combined with data hosted in Google Sheets. Created by NPR.
